     * We distinct the following cases:
     *
     * 1) A Packet is pushed by the ToNetlink Element. An application has sent a pub/sub request. See helper.hh for possible cases.
     * LocalProxy first finds or creates the respective LocalHost object and then inspects the type of the request:
     *
     *  a) DISCONNECT: calls the disconnect method, kills the packet and returns.
     *
     *  b) PUBLISH_DATA: Calls handleUserPublication() method. A special case is when the LocalRV publishes an RV/TM notification (e.g. in a NODE_LOCAL case or in a DOMAIN_LOCAL in the domain's rendezvous node).
     *
     *  c) All other requests: Reads all fields exported to the API and calls the handleLocalRequest() method.
     * Then, depending on the output of this method it may publish the user request to a remote Blackadder node (a rendezvous point) using the publishReqToRV() method or not (the packet is killed).
     *
     *
     * 2) A Packet is pushed by another Click Element (e.g. the LocalRV Element). This case is the same as the 1st. The only difference is that the LocalHost is a Click Element.
     * In both of these cases requests are formatted according to the exported service model are expected.
     *
     * 3) A Packet is pushed by the Forwarder Element. This is a network publication.
     * Network publications may have multiple information identifiers. LocalProxy reads them all and pulls everything from the packet except from the payload. Then, it calls the handleNetworkPublication() method.
     * A special case is when the publication identifier is the /FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFD/NODEID.
     * This publications are RV/TM notifications, therefore the processRVNotification() method is called (after pulling everything from the packet except from the payload, which in this case is the notification).
     * Then the Packet is deleted (p->kill()).
