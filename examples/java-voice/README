To run the Java-based voice app
-------------------------------

1. First update (or create your own) config.txt file. Make sure to set the JNI_PATH variable so that it points to the location of the blackadder java binding library (eu_pursuit_client_BlackadderWrapper.o). The Java binding is located in blackadder-dir/lib/bindings/java-binding. See the binding's README file for building the java-binding. The BUFFER_SIZE variable defines the voice packet sizes. Do not change it, otherwise you are at your own risk (e.g. blackadder may discard packets for being too large).

2. While in the java-voice directory, execute from the command-line

./run-application.sh -f conf_file

where conf_file is the configuration file.

Requirements
-----------------------------------------

The Blackadder Java voice app has been tested with blackadder v0.2 and the respective Java binding. It requires Java 1.5+ (the same as the binding) and has been tested in Ubuntu Linux with openjdk installed.

In addition you need Visual Swing for Eclipse. See install.txt in the ./lib directory for further instructions.
