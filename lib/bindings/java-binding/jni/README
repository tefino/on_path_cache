The jni binding is built and tested with openjdk. To install the openjdk implementation of the JVM, run

sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

Then, open the Makefile and edit the second line (the one that declares variable JNI_INC) so that it points to the correct directory. If you don't know where jni header files are located, run a 

locate jni.h

on a terminal. Again, make sure you are using openjdk.
