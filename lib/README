Blackadder API Library
**********************

Installation
============

# ./configure
# make && make install

If needed, you can regenerate `./configure' by running `autoreconf -i'.

See the `INSTALL' file for general information about `configure' and
`make'.

Language Bindings
=================

By default, only the default C++ API is compiled and installed.

Additional language bindings can be enabled by passing one or more
`--enable-LANGUAGE' options to `configure'. Run `./configure --help'
to see which languages are supported.

Some additional stand-alone language bindings can also be found in
their respective directories under the `bindings' directory. Such
bindings need to be compiled (and installed) separately.
